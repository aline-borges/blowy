 You will be redirected to the link http://localhost:19002/. The application automatically reloads each change in the code.

If you don't already have a packager running for this project, expo will start one for you.

:pushpin: Please note: When you run expo build, Expo automatically publishes your app (with expo publish). In order to avoid accidentally publishing changes to your production app, you may want to use release channels.
